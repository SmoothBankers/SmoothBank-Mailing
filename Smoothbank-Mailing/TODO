TODO:
	Create service that will take calls to create a token and return the sequence representing that token
	Create email message sender that can take the token sequence string and use it
	Possibly designate a format for handling the confirmation link
	
Approach is as follows, some code (not important to the email service) sends in some data T, a String for the
	link to add to the url, and a String representation of an email address. 
	A token is created for the data T, and that token is then stored in the database to allow for
	persistence. The token is also sent to a message and used in the path for the url link.
	The message is created and sent to the provided email address and the mail service stops there.
	Confirmation is done by the caller, though they should use the token given in the path variable
	of the link URL to retrieve the Token from the database, running any operation if the token is
	still valid (checked using the Token.isAlive() method) or deleting the token should it not be
	valid.
